            Ragi, also known as finger millet, a nutritious powerhouse and climate-resilient crop, is experiencing a revival in Odisha. Already boasting the largest area under ragi cultivation in India, at over 54,000 hectares, the state is committed to further enhancing production.
        </p>
        <p>In 2017-18, the state produced one lakh metric tonnes of ragi, and this figure surged to 2.26 lakh metric tonnes (MT) in 2022-23. The cultivated area has also expanded during this period. Odisha ranks second among Indian states in ragi production, following Karnataka. The yield rate has seen an upward trend, with millet farmers achieving 880 kg per hectare in 2017-18 and an impressive 1268 kg per hectare in 2022-23. Ragi cultivation covered 1.14 lakh hectares in 2017-18, and this area has now expanded to 1.79 lakh hectares. The state actively procures ragi on a large scale, having acquired around six lakh quintals in 2022. Approximately 85 percent of the millet crop area in Odisha is dedicated to finger millet (ragi) cultivation. The state aims to procure eight lakh quintals this year, with the current Minimum Support Price (MSP) for ragi set at Rs 3846 per quintal. The remaining 15 percent is utilized for non-ragi millets such as foxtail millet and little millet. </p>
        <p>The Odisha Millet Mission has played a crucial role, offering minimum support prices, promoting farmer varieties, and encouraging improved agronomic practices. However, there's room for improvement. Investing in research for high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties, providing access to quality seeds and technology, and establishing efficient irrigation systems are key steps.</p>
        <p>Additionally, creating value-added products, connecting farmers to markets, and raising consumer awareness about ragi's health benefits can boost demand and incentivize production. By addressing these aspects, Odisha can solidify its position as a national leader in ragi agriculture, empowering farmers, optimizing harvesting techniques & nurturing the landâ€™s potential and contributing to a healthier, more sustainable food system.</p>
